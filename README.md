# Connect 4 - Game Rules

## Objective
The goal of Connect 4 is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

## Setup
- The game is played on a vertical grid of 7 columns and 6 rows.
- Each player has a set of colored discs. One player uses red discs, and the other uses yellow discs.

## How to Play
1. **Starting the Game**: 
   - Players decide who goes first (traditionally, the player with the red discs).
   - Players take turns dropping one of their colored discs from the top into any of the seven columns.

2. **Placing Discs**:
   - Discs fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.
   - A disc cannot be placed in a column if it is already full (i.e., all six slots are occupied).

3. **Winning the Game**:
   - A player wins by connecting four of their own discs consecutively in any direction: horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   - The game ends immediately when a player achieves four in a row.

4. **Draw**:
   - If the grid is completely filled with discs and neither player has four in a row, the game ends in a draw.

## Additional Rules
- **No Undo**: Once a disc is dropped into a column, the move cannot be undone or changed.

Enjoy playing Connect 4!
